# ðŸ§ª Data Alchemist - Demo Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Demo

The Data Alchemist application is now running at **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 1: Upload Sample Data
1. Open the application in your browser
2. You'll see three upload areas for Clients, Workers, and Tasks
3. Use the sample data files in the `sample-data/` folder:
   - `sample-data/clients.csv` - Upload to Clients
   - `sample-data/workers.csv` - Upload to Workers  
   - `sample-data/tasks.csv` - Upload to Tasks

### Step 2: Explore Data Management
1. After uploading, you'll see interactive data grids
2. Click on any cell to edit data inline
3. Notice validation errors highlighted in red
4. Click "Run Validation" to see comprehensive validation results

### Step 3: Try AI Features
1. Go to the "AI Features" tab in the sidebar
2. **Natural Language Search**: Try queries like:
   - "clients with priority level 5"
   - "workers with programming skills"
   - "tasks with duration more than 3 phases"
3. **AI Suggestions**: View AI-powered recommendations for data improvements

### Step 4: Create Business Rules
1. Go to the "Business Rules" tab
2. Click "AI Assistant" to try natural language rule creation
3. Try: "Tasks T001 and T002 must run together"
4. Or manually create rules using the UI

### Step 5: Set Priorities
1. Go to the "Prioritization" tab
2. Adjust sliders to set allocation weights
3. Try preset profiles like "Maximize Fulfillment"
4. See real-time weight distribution visualization

### Step 6: Export Data
1. Go to the "Export" tab
2. Review validation status
3. Click "Export All Data" to download cleaned files
